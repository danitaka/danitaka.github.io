<h2>Week 1</h2>
          <p>What is the relationship between diagrams and meaning?<br><br>
Diagrams are simple graphics used to communicate ideas in an easy, visual way. A diagram’s purpose is the information it holds. Often times, they give direction and convey relationships between elements. They are mainly intended as a summary of information. Specific details can then be expended and touched upon in bodies of text. In the context of a website, diagrams are used for navigation and to show progression. They never show a full process, however. If they did, they would no longer be diagrams. One of the most important things a diagram can do is present a hierarchy of information and organization of media. In reference to “The Mechanism of Meaning,” diagrams can present ambiguous zones, split meaning, map meaning, and reassemble meaning. Like Michael Whittle’s article says, Arakawa used diagrams to “map out the poetic-conceptual terrain their work explored.” In addition, a diagram is never about one single thing. Diagrams show parts of a whole and how they fit and work together in the process.

What is the difference between diagrams for art and non art?<br><br>
Arakawa referred to himself as a “coordinologist” instead of an “artist.” While there is a clear difference between diagrams made for art and diagrams made for non art, all diagrams have artistic value. Whittle argues that “the categories of Arakawa and Gins blend the objective and subjective qualities to resonate in a way that [he] describes as ‘romantic objective.’”Diagrams made for art tend to be either more abstract or detailed than diagrams for non art. Diagrams made for non art are explicit and simple because their main purpose is to communicate better than written words can. Their highest priority is to be a tool, whereas diagrams for art do not seek to serve the viewer. Both are visualizations, but they differ in levels of complexity and organization.</p>

<h2>Week 2</h2>
      <p>How is Ayn Rand's philosophy relevant today?<br><br>
Ayn Rand’s philosophy is relevant today because it applies to the freedom and anarchy of the internet. Like Rand believed, the internet operates with no central control of technology. Ayn Rand challenged altruism and instead promoted being purely rational. There is no need to care for others, as you are your own world. With the level of detachment the internet can provide, this logical practice is frequently practiced online. Emotions are diluted, easy to ignore, and not completely communicated online, leading to an indifference for others.<br><br><br>
How was the internet shaped by Objectivism?<br><br>
Objectivism is the idea that human beings are alone in the universe and must free themselves from political and religious control. They live their lives guided only by their selfish desires to become heroic figures. This applied to the internet’s creation as it is not controlled by a single institution. There is no censorship, unified system, or limits. While physical access may be unequal and controlled, on the internet, there is no power to constrain anyone.
What is Californian Ideology?
The Californian Ideology argues that if humans are linked by computers, together, they can create their own kind of order. It promotes radical individualism and utopian theories about the internet. With it, the ideology sees the world as one interconnected system. Politicians should not try to control it and instead let the individual have freedom. Man is entitled to his own happiness and must work to achieve himself. When you die, the world ends. I believe that it is true human nature to lean towards Rand’s philosophy of selfishness on a personal level, however, I don’t believe that is the way our society is practiced. For example, Bill Clinton found that when he cut funding to control the internet and market, political power had just been transferred to another elite, the financiers of Wall Street, leading to corruption and exploitation.</p>

<h2>Week 3</h2>

        <p>What was the cultural impact of cybenetics?<br>
Do you think humans can be undestood through cybernetics?<br>
Is cybernetics a usefull tool for describing reality?<br><br>
How is materiality manifested in poor images? <br>
        What is the political value of the poor image?<br>
        What is the relationship of speed or velocity and digital images?<br><br>
        In Hito Steyerl’s “In Defense of the Poor Image,” the “poor image” is defined as a bad quality,
        mass produced copy of an image. It takes the form as a preview, thumbnail, and the “ghost of
        an image.” Often times, the loss of resolution is caused from being copied, edited, and shared
        so many times. Each time, the image gets “poorer” and further away from the original content.
        Poor images are deliberately made as mockery, satire, and protest. They are meant to be easily
        accessible, easily made, and countless. Materiality is manifested in poor images because focus
        and image quality indicate class, privilege. They affect the hierarchy of information. Hegemonic
        image standards revolve around resolution. As technology continues to evolve, and we are able
        to capture higher and higher resolutions, resolution value increases. In addition, image
        resolution also indicates class because the tools used to capture and display high resolution
        images increase in expense with the resolution. They can become inaccessible to many,
        creating a divide. Poor images work in protest because they are nonconformant to to style,
        quality standards and private ownership. As they decline in quality, they decline in richness and
        variety. They become more simplistic and straightforward. Many times they are used in
        battleground for commercial and national agendas in an experimental and artistic way. For
        example, “the poor image embodies the afterlife of many former masterpieces of cinema and
        video art.” It can be used to bastardize, usurp, and reimagine cultural works. The poor image
        has political value because it is disruptive and feeds into capitalist media. It is not about the
        original work but imposing its own “real conditions of existence.” With the speed of media in
        today’s era, its dispersion makes it successful.</p>

        <h2>Week 4</h2>

                <p>“All Over by Machines” investigated the paradigm shift in ecology from the 20th to modern world views. When the internet was first evolving, old hierarchies of power were being replaced by new systems. Forward thinking dreamt of systems that could balance themselves without authoritarian power. All systems depend on feedback, but computers could now be used to analyze and predict consequences. Cybernetics saw people as parts of the system, nodes and networks, not individual beings. This system of thinking became heavily influenced by nature, but it viewed nature as a self-balancing system with predictability. I was fascinated by Buckminster Fuller’s idea that the world should be seen as one giant spaceship and that all human beings should try to manage that spaceship. While I agree that this is a positive motivation to care for a community, the whole system had a huge flaw in its understanding of nature. Ecologists found empirical evidence that ecosystems do not tend towards equilibrium, but are in a constant, dynamic, and unpredictable state of change. I understand why people were viscerally upset, it is an uncomfortable feeling to be out of control. However, it makes sense, without instability, we wouldn't have evolution of animals and the same goes for the internet. Just like cybernetics misunderstood the non-equilibrium and chaos of nature, I do not think humans can be understood through cybernetics; they are too unpredictable. Humans are individuals, and will act as such, no matter what ideology is imposed on them. I do see the value in the order and equality it tries to bring to the world, but don’t think it is an accurate tool for describing reality. We cannot make the same mistake of oversimplification.
